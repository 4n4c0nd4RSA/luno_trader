# üìä Market Perception Formula Update

We're excited to announce an improvement to our Market Perception formula! The new version now incorporates both short-term and long-term market differences, providing a more comprehensive analysis. Let's dive into the details of this update.

## üîç Overview

The updated formula enhances our ability to assess market perception by considering both immediate and extended market trends. This change allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of market dynamics.

## üìà The Formulas

### Confidence Formula
```
Confidence = f(x_diff, y_diff) = 1 - (1 / (1 + e^(-(y_diff / x_diff))))
```

### Old Market Perception Formula
```
Old Market Perception = f(x_long_diff, y_long_diff) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(y_diff / x_diff)))
```

### New Market Perception Formula
```
New Market Perception = f(x_diff, y_diff, x_long_diff, y_long_diff) = 1 / (1 + e^(-((y_long_diff + y_diff) / (x_long_diff - x_diff))))
```
