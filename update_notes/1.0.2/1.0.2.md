# Luno Trader Update Notes - Version 1.0.2

## What's New?

We've introduced a new way to measure market trends called the Market Momentum Indicator (MMI). This new tool combines our existing measures to give us a clearer picture of what's happening in the market. Additionally, we've added a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) graph for enhanced technical analysis.

### Market Momentum Indicator (MMI)
- MMI is a new metric that combines our two existing indicators:
  - Market Perception (MP): Our view of the overall market trend
  - Price Confidence (PC): Our assessment of short-term price movements
- We calculate MMI like this: MMI = (MP + PC) / 2

### Improved Trend Line Calculation
- We've introduced an "average window size" for calculating trend lines
- This new method uses the average of multiple data points instead of just the first and last points
- The default average window size is 30 data points
- This change makes our trend lines smoother and more representative of overall price movements

### Better Graphs
- Our Price Confidence Graph now shows the new MMI
- The Trader Confidence Graph also displays MMI alongside our other metrics
- Trend lines on our graphs now reflect the new average-based calculation
- We've added a new MACD graph for additional technical analysis

### MACD Graph
- The MACD graph has been added to provide more advanced technical analysis
- It shows the MACD line, signal line
- This graph helps identify potential buy and sell signals based on crossovers and divergences
- You can enable then view the MACD line on the Luno exchange at https://www.luno.com/trade/markets/XBTZAR
- The fast, slow, signal, and candle periods used in our MACD calculations visually correspond to the settings available on the Luno exchange

### Calculation of MMI
It's important to note that the Market Momentum Indicator (MMI) is calculated as the average of Market Perception and Price Confidence:

```
MMI = (Market Perception + Price Confidence) / 2
```

This means that MMI provides a balanced view of both long-term and short-term market trends, which is used in our decision-making process.

## Understanding the Positive MMI Angle

We've introduced a new visual representation to help understand when the Market Momentum Indicator (MMI) is positive. This is illustrated in the following image:

### The MMI Angle
- The MMI is considered positive when it's above 0.5
- We represent this visually as an angle in a 2D space
- The angle is formed by the Market Perception (MP) and Price Confidence (PC) values

## Configuration Changes

We've renamed some of our configuration settings to make them clearer and added new ones for MACD:

- `SHORT_THRESHOLD` is now called `PRICE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`
- `THRESHOLD` is now called `MARKET_PERCEPTION_THRESHOLD`
- We've added a new setting: `MARKET_MOMENTUM_INDICATOR_THRESHOLD`
- We've added a new setting: `AVERAGE_WINDOW_SIZE`
- We've added a new setting: `MACD_FAST_PERIOD`
- We've added a new setting: `MACD_SLOW_PERIOD`
- We've added a new setting: `MACD_SIGNAL_PERIOD`
- We've added a new setting: `MACD_CANDLE_PERIOD`

These new names should make it easier to understand what each setting does. You can adjust these thresholds to fine-tune the system's sensitivity to different market conditions.

### MACD Configuration
- `MACD_FAST_PERIOD`: The number of periods for the fast moving average (default: 120)
- `MACD_SLOW_PERIOD`: The number of periods for the slow moving average (default: 260)
- `MACD_SIGNAL_PERIOD`: The number of periods for the signal line (default: 90)
- `MACD_CANDLE_PERIOD`: The time frame for each candle in the MACD calculation (default: '300' for 5 minutes)

These settings align with the MACD configuration options available on the Luno exchange (https://www.luno.com/trade/markets/XBTZAR). You can experiment with different values to see how they affect the MACD signals and compare them with the Luno exchange's MACD graph.

## New Trading Rules

We've updated our trading rules to incorporate the new MACD signal. The `determine_action` function now handles buy/sell decisions based on the following conditions:

### Buy Conditions:
- Market Perception ≥ (0.5 + MARKET_PERCEPTION_THRESHOLD)
- Price Confidence ≥ (0.5 + PRICE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
- MACD > Signal Line
- Sufficient ZAR balance

### Sell Conditions:
- Market Perception ≤ (0.5 - MARKET_PERCEPTION_THRESHOLD)
- Price Confidence ≤ (0.5 - PRICE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD)
- MACD < Signal Line
- Sufficient BTC balance

If none of these conditions are met, the bot takes no action.

These new trading rules provide more flexibility, allowing the system to respond to various market conditions more effectively. The combination of MMI, short-term confidence, and MACD signals aims to provide a more accurate and nuanced view of market trends.

## Other Improvements
- Our graphs now adjust better to show all the data
- We've made the layout of our graphs clearer and easier to read
- The zoom feature on our graphs works better now

## Technical Stuff (for the curious)
- We've cleaned up our code to make it run faster and be easier to update in the future
- We've fixed some bugs that were causing issues with our graphs and data
- The new average window size calculation is implemented in both the `calculate_price_slope` function and the `update_plot` function
- This change makes our trend calculations more robust against short-term price fluctuations

This update aims to make our trading system smarter and easier to understand. By introducing the Market Momentum Indicator, improving our trend line calculations, and adding MACD analysis, we're providing a more accurate and nuanced view of market conditions. The new trading rules provide more flexibility, allowing the system to respond to various market conditions more effectively. The renaming of our configuration settings and the introduction of new parameters should also make it easier to adjust the system to your needs.
